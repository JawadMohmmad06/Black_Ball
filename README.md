Description:
This project is a game developed in Unity using the C# programming language. The objective of the game is to control a ball and guide it to the finish line while avoiding obstacles and collecting items to gain a high score.

    ##  Game Rules:
    1. The player controls the ball using the A key to move left, the D key to move right, and the W key to jump.
    2. The ball must avoid colliding with walls and falling from the ground, as both actions will result in a game over.
    3. The player can collect cylinders throughout the game to increase their score.
    4. Touching the flame object will grant the ball an anti bump ability, providing temporary protection against collisions.
    5. Green capsules will give the ball a small kick, boosting its speed or agility.

## Features:
- Smooth ball movement using Unity's physics engine.
- Realistic collision detection and response to prevent the ball from going through walls or falling off the ground.
- Dynamic scoring system based on the number of collected cylinders.
- Power-up items (flame and green capsules) to enhance gameplay.
- User-friendly controls using the A, D, and W keys.
- Visually appealing graphics and effects.
